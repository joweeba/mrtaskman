# Boolean
# If True then ProdEagle will export data from AppStats.

# List[Integers]
# Here is an exmaple with APPSTATS_PERCENTILE = [90].

# If True then ProdEagle exports separate AppStat results for

# If not False then ProdEagle will export detailed AppStat results for all
# requests that have a url that match the regexp.

#--------------------------- Log Export Configuration -------------------------

# Boolean
# If True then ProdEagle exports cost per request & amount of requests from the

# If you have a lot of traffic, we recommend that you set SAVE_IN_BETWEEN to 60
# at least 60 so you have a continues graph.

# --------- Settings if you have low accuracy or missing data -----------------

# Integer
# If greater than 0 ProdEagle will automatically add a TaskQueue job to collect
